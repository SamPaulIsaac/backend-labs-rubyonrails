## Overview

**Backend Labs â€“ Ruby on Rails** is a collection of backend service experiments built using **Rails**, a convention-driven full-stack framework known for developer productivity.

This repository is part of a polyglot backend series alongside labs in Java, Node.js, and Go, aimed at comparing real-world implementations across stacks.

The focus here is on:
- Rapid API prototyping using **Rails APIs-only mode**
- Exploring Rails conventions and metaprogramming
- Understanding MVC, routing, validations, and database workflows
- Evaluating productivity vs. control trade-offs across frameworks

---

## Technology Stack

- Ruby 3.2+
- Ruby on Rails 7.x (API-only mode)
- PostgreSQL or SQLite
- Redis (optional)
- Sidekiq / ActiveJob (planned)
- RSpec / Minitest (for testing)

---

## Repository Structure

Each experiment or service is organized as a separate Rails app under `apps/`, with the following layout:

- apps/ # Rails API apps and service experiments
- notes/ # Framework notes, design trade-offs, patterns
- scripts/ # Setup, seeding, or deployment utilities


Each app includes:
- Its own `Gemfile` and Rails setup
- Clean API structure (no frontend views)
- Context-specific `README.md`
